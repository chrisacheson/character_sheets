arthur curwen, war vet, used to own cornthwaite's house, murdered family with an axe (around 1890)

cornthwaite went to south america 4 years ago, wasn't the same when he came back, looked pale and ill, never shook it off

weird discolored spot in fireplace
	and in sink - slimy, viscous
	started moving

"nacl" on mirror - hurts slimy stuff


DEAD!
